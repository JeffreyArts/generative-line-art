You can specify options by adding query parameters to the url. (Query parameters are specified at the end of the url by ?points=2&tension=0&...)

*points* A number to specify the amount of points per canvas/screen
*tension* A number which determines the curve strength between two points. 0 = no curve, 10 is max.
